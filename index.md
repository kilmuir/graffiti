## GEOB 472 Interactive Mapping Assignment:
## What and Where is Public Art?

Author: Alec Francis

I have long been interested in what constitutes legitimate forms of public creative expression. My goal for this project was to juxtapose the distribution of public art sanctioned by the city with the distribution of graffiti around the city. Vancouver has plenty of both, and keeps up to date records. While I don't have a particular target audience in mind, my hope is that such a map could be accessible to the average Vancouverite. Perhaps such a map could serve to open the dialogue surrounding public artistic expression in Vancouver, and call in to question the supposed dichotomy between public art and graffiti. I should note here that I do not necessarily sanction nor condemn the activities of graffiti-ists. While the artistic merit of much graffiti is questionable, I would argue the same could be said of many of the city-sponsored installations.

In order to convey the two distributions on a single map, I first decided to represent the 'layers' as heatmaps, where frequency of occurence controls intensity of color. The heatmap is adjusted so that the symbology adjusts in size as the user zooms in or out. The map's primary interactivity is the slider which the user can move across the screen to see a given amount of one of the layers. Initially, I was going to use a toggle to switch between the two layers, but I decided that the slider provided a more continuous and 'customisable' interactive experience. I considered adding more interactive elements (such as information boxes etc.); however, I ultimately decided that for my goals, it made sense to limit the *interface scope* (Roth, 2017) to functions that the user would be likely to use and hopefully from which to gain insight. Given that most users are unlikely to spend a considerable amount of time exploring all the intricacies of a highly detailed interactive map, the bold simplicity of the slider seemed to make the most sense.

Visual design is also an important element of interactive mapping. Roth (2017) writes: "the visual look and feel of the UI design is 'more than just icing on the cake': it sets the tone for the entire user experience". To this end, I attempted to make a map which did not sacrifice visual appeal to interactivity. I used <a href = 'http://colorbrewer2.org/' title = "Colorbrewer" target = "_blank">colorbrewer</a> to generate gradient color schemes for the two layers and I tried to use a colour scheme that is easy to look at. I chose the mapbox dark style as I found it to be the least visually intrusive of the premade mapbox styles.
