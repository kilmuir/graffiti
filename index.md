## GEOB 472 Interactive Mapping Assignment:
## What and Where is Public Art?

Author: Alec Francis

I have long been interested in what constitutes legitimate forms of public creative expression. My goal for this project was to juxtapose the distribution of public art sanctioned by the city with the distribution of graffiti around the city. Vancouver has plenty of both, and keeps up to date records. I should note here that I do not necessarily sanction nor condemn the activities of graffiti-ists. While the artistic merit of much graffiti is questionable, I would argue the same could be said of many of the city-sponsored installations.

In order to convey the two distributions on a single map, I first decided to represent the 'layers' as heatmaps, where frequency of occurence controls intensity of color. The heatmap is adjusted so that the symbology adjusts in size as the user zooms in or out. The map's primary interactivity is the slider which the user can move across the screen to see a given amount of one of the layers. Initially, I was going to use a toggle to switch between the two layers, but I decided that the slider provided a more continuous and 'customisable' interactive experience.
