{ "type": "Feature", "properties": { "TitleOfWork": "Captain George Vancouver", "YearOfInstallation": "1936", "Status": "In place", "DescriptionOfwork": "A full figure bronze statue of Captain George Vancouver stands on the north side of City Hall, pointing towards Vancouver harbour and holding a partially open scroll in his left hand. The figure commemorates the events of 1792, when Captain George, a representative of King George III of England, sailed into Burrard Inlet and charted the area.", "ArtistProjectStatement": "A new city hall and a statue of Captain George Vancouver were commissioned to commemorate Vancouver's Golden Jubilee in 1936. The architect of the new City Hall at Strathcona Park on West 12th Avenue, Fred Townley, proposed the sculpture, commissioned by the Vancouver Canadian Club, be placed on the plaza on the north side of the building. Noted BC sculptor, Charles Marega, was commissioned (for about $5500) to create a life-size sculpture of the man who mapped the harbour in 1792 and after whom the city is named. Marega began by setting up 500 pounds of clay on a turntable in his Hornby Street Studio. From the clay model, he made a plaster cast which was then used to cast the finished work in \"Roman bronze\". It was cast at Ornamental Bronze, a foundry in Vancouver. The work was installed on August 20, 1936.The bronze figure standing atop the granite plinth is said to bear little physical resemblance to Captain George. The sculpture was copied from a maquette, which had been fashioned after a painting that was in turn, a copy from an original painting.An interesting conversation is recorded between Major Matthews, the City Archivist, and Townley. Matthews: \"Mr. Townley, the \"Sun\" newspaper wants to know how much the Vancouver statue cost and who paid for it.\"Townley: \"What do they want to bring that up for? Leave sleeping dogs lie. I've been afraid that matter would come up, but it has not...why bring it up now? It was all in the contract; everything was above board; there's nothing to hide; but if it gets out what it cost, then some fool will start writing to the newspapers, or something, and complain of the waste of money; say it ought to have been given towards the support of some fool scheme of his own, the \"home for incurable dogs\", or some other idiotic thing\".Matthews: \"Alright; drop it, I don't want to know; the \"Sun\" is publishing a story on the statue, and I suppose they want to put the cost in.\"Townley: \"Well, Charles Marega made it, and baby bonds paid for it...I don't know exactly what it cost; it would be hard to find out; part of it was in the stone work cost. Marega for $5000, and then there was the base; so much per square foot for the base, perhaps $500 for that...\"The statue was cleaned in 2001, 65 years after its installation and in time for the city's 115th birthday. The bill for cost of cleaning was $5800, almost the same amount as the original statue cost. This sculpture is on the City of Vancouver's Heritage Inventory list and, as a proud homage to a great explorer, has stood the test of time.", "SiteName": "Vancouver City Hall", "SiteAddress": "453 West 12th Avenue", "Neighbourhood": "Mount Pleasant", "Latitude": 49.261185, "Longitude": -123.113918, "LocationOnsite": "North entrance, exterior, in front of stairs", "Type": "Figure", "PrimaryMaterial": "bronze", "Ownership": "City of Vancouver", "URL": "https:\/\/covapp.vancouver.ca\/PublicArtRegistry\/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=1", "PhotoURL": "https:\/\/covapp.vancouver.ca\/PublicArtRegistry\/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=1&ImageId=1", "PhotoCredits": "Barbara Cole", "Artists": "98", "size": 1 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.113918, 49.261185 ] } },

In September of 1968, Douglas Brown, a Vancouver lawyer, talked to sculptor Elek Imredy about his desire to commission a sculpture inspired by the famous Copenhagen mermaid, which could be sited on the great granite boulder just off the northern shore of Stanley Park. Imredy proposed a life-size bronze sculpture of a scuba diver. On Brown's initiative, the Vancouver Harbour Improvement Society was formed with the intention of financing and facilitating a unique landmark for both Vancouverites and visitors to the city. They raised the money to produce the sculpture privately and Imredy was commissioned to craft the proposed work. The Vancouver Park Board gave permission to the society to place the sculpture on the rock. Because the boulder was often covered at high tide, a precast concrete ring was created and the rock was lifted by a floating crane and set on the ring about 100 feet from its original location.  Imredy first took a mold of the top surface of the rock. In his studio, he made a replica of the rock and modeled the figure in clay. Imredy asked his young friend Debra Harrington to model, however the sculpture is not recognizably her image. \"When I couldn't get the model to hold her hand the way I wanted it... I held my left hand in front of a mirror, showing its opposite, and I modeled   right one. Of course, I made it a bit nicer, with longer fingers.\" A plaster of paris mold was made from the clay figure and the sculpture was cast in fibreglass. This fibreglass figure was flown to Rome where it was cast in bronze at Giovanni and Angelo Nicci's foundry. On June 9th, 1972, the sculpture was set in place by an electric crane reaching out from shore to the rock 8o feet away and fastened to the stone with stainless steel bolts. The next day the sculpture was ceremoniously unveiled. \"Girl in Wetsuit\" has become a landmark for visitors to Stanley Park and to boats that enter the harbour.", "ArtistProjectStatement": "\"I didn't believe we should have a copy of the mermaid (in Copenhagen harbour). She is rightfully a symbol of Copenhagen... I proposed to have a life-size scuba diver seated there.

The opportunity for a sculpture was offered to the city by Hugh Faulkner, Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs at the time.

A committee was formed in conjunction with Capilano College and a subsequent national competition drew 98 entries. Toronto artist Beth Alber won with the design incorporating 14 pink granite benches in a circle.  It stands as a reminder of violence against women in society.  The competition policies state that, \"The Women's Monument is conceived as a rational monument to be located in Vancouver, BC, dedicated to all women who have been murdered by men, and naming the 14 women killed in Montreal on Dec 6,1989. It will provide a focus for healing and a tangible symbol of remembrance.\" Beth Alber's artist proposal states,  \"The circle, the symbol used by women for centuries to represent a continuum, in a non-hierarchical way, is one of the major elements for this Women's Monument. It is a symbol of women's spirit and is associated with the idea of a protected or consecrated space.\"  During the course of the project, considerable controversy was stirred up by the wording of the inscription which is dedicated to \"all women who have been murdered by men\".  Many people felt this inscription was too political. Some were critical about the eventual cost of the monument, approximately $500,000, which they felt could have been put to better purpose.  Many felt that the monument was too specific and was inappropriately sited in a public place, and that public money shouldn't be used to commemorate what was construed to be a private grief.

The first is 39 colorful mosaic spiral galaxies scattered across the site. The brilliantly colorful mosaic tiles stand in marked contrast to the second element, colored stone aggregate which has been laid down in large abstract fiels and which represent the \"cosmic sea\". The third element is 170 fibre optic point lights, in four different intensities, which represent the stars in 36 constellations. These \"stars\" are each set into a black granite star shaped tile and each constellation is further defined by lines of polished brass set into the aggregate. The last element is three large bronze castings of cargo ships, commonly seen in Vancouver's harbour - a fishing trawler, a tug and gravel barge, and a BC ferry - all seen from above.This work is both public and private, it welcomes both day and night viewing (in some sense providing its own light), and it enhances both public space and the developer's concerns for place making and site harmony. \"Milky Way\" is a successful example of Vancouver's public art program which has emphasized \"site specific\" public art instead of traditional sculpture.", "ArtistProjectStatement": "\"By day, a swirling mosaic paints the night sky beneath our footsteps.

The granite has been designed and laid out in four shapes reflecting four different starlight intensities. Third, alluding to humankind's historical fascination with navigation of the heavens, four large bronze castings of ships, icons familiar to Vancouver's harbours, are set at each port or threshold of entry - a fishing trawler, a gravel barge and tug, and an 18-foot long ferry. Finally, the 40 colour fields of stone aggregate, which overlay and unite all the elements, are abstractions of colour maps made of the Milky Ways' \"cosmic sea.\" The recurring fours and forties and their multiples in the work refer to wholeness, totality, and completion (appropriate for a work completed at the end of the millennium).\" (From news release for public opening ceremony)", "SiteName": "The Lions", "SiteAddress": "1300 West Georgia", "Neighbourhood": "West End", "Latitude": 49.288328, "Longitude": -123.127743, "LocationOnsite": "Exterior plaza walkway running diagonally between Georgia & Alberni", "Type": "Mosaic", "PrimaryMaterial": "Stone aggregate, glass & granite tile, brass & bronze inserts, fibre optics", "Ownership": "Privately Owned", "URL": "https:\/\/covapp.vancouver.ca\/PublicArtRegistry\/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=313", "PhotoURL": "https:\/\/covapp.vancouver.ca\/PublicArtRegistry\/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=313&ImageId=252", "PhotoCredits": "Colin Goldie", "Artists": "51", "size": 1 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -123.127743, 49.288328 ] } },

The black and white bands of stone may recall 12th century Italian church architecture. The gold leafed spheres with the projecting necks are suggestive of the retorts of the medieval alchemists whose putative ambition was to transmute lead into gold. The gold forms also suggest the popular symbols of the male and female. In addition the tower or column elevates the gold objects and, by making them inaccessible, enhances their mystery. Resting lightly on the column in spite of their considerable mass, the scale and precarious position of the spheres imply the possibility of arrival from some unknown place and time to briefly alight before moving on - a suggestion of a mind or consciousness, of the anthropomorphic?

The figure faces the direction of the wind as indicated by the four directionals and the tipped arrow upon which it rests. Closer investigation reveals this to be Rodney Graham√≠s Weathervane sculpture, which depicts the artist dressed as 16th Century humanist and classical scholar, Erasmus. Absorbed in the solitary activity of reading, the figure is lost in thought and contemplation, not having to worry about where he is going or what lies ahead but, as Rodney Graham puts it, is able to √´ponder on horseback√≠  moving forward but also looking backward, to the past.  Rodney Graham based the weathervane on a contemporary anecdote which claimed that Erasmus wrote his most well-known work, The Praise of Folly, on horseback during a journey from Italy to England circa 1510. Graham plays on the absurdism inherent in reading a philosophical treatise on human folly whilst riding on a horse backwards and continues his ongoing philosophical enquiry into cyclical and backward movement; like all his work it contains a complex narrative and is brimful of references: literary, philosophical, self-referential and art historical.  Rodney Graham√≠s poetic and humourous weathervane, helpfully indicating wind direction and compass points for any serious traveller who looks upward to contemplate the conditions for travel, continues his preoccupation with un-urgent journeying. Erasmus travels from Italy to England leisurely by horseback, the cowboy meanders gently off the beaten track, the buccaneer√≠s unknown voyage which has thrown him up on a √¨treasure island√Æ, and the chemically-induced mental journeys that take place in the artist√≠s head, remind us even if we are not going anywhere in particular that √´the trip is the thing√≠.(Rodney Graham in conversation with Iwona Blazwick, Director, Whitechapel Gallery, October 14th 20082 Rodney Graham in Rodney Graham, Whitechapel Art Gallery, London 2002 p.109)", "SiteName": "Pomaria", "SiteAddress": "1455 Howe Street, Vancouver, B.C.

Spanning four stories of the building, Double Blind  translates a Snellen, or eye, chart into Braille by using dome mirrors in order to emulate the raised dots of Braille script.Dome mirrors are endemic to public spaces and can be found in pedestrian underpasses, hospital corridors, and in commercial retail contexts. They are used for surveillance as well as for the prevention of collisions in pedestrian traffic flow. Public space is often highly contested since it must typically answer to the idealist demands of communal space while also satisfying the concerns for public safety that are frequently associated with control and surveillance. Like many atriums, the new Vancouver Community College√≠s interior public space has a panoptic tendency: emphasizing √´insight√≠ into various interior spaces from specific vantage points. This panoptic tendency is echoed in the domed mirrors, each reflecting a 360‚àû view of the surrounding space.Double Blind deliberately and emphatically utilizes elements that are commonly found in public space and re-purposes them, thereby highlighting the quality of the space itself, rather than offering a pictorial escape from its reality. Double Blind queries the interlinked ideas of seeing and controlling, acknowledging the importance of the context in which information is acquired and processed, whether that context is a scientific doctrine, social matrix, or language system.This sculptural work is accompanied by a T-shirt multiple that echoes the installation√≠s oxymoronic premise: those who can see the work likely don√≠t read braille, and those who read braille can probably not see the work.On the back of each T-shirt, an eye chart is rendered in raised letters.

It is a symbol that has circulated in largely provisional terms.  My idea was to formalize the symbol through scale and permanence.  Although its precise origins are not known, the symbol does date back to at least the late 1940s (according to the memory of some senior citizens), which is the beginning of the post 2nd World War period.  Its roots may be linked to the Catholic inscription of East Vancouver culture at that time, home as it was to many Italians, Greeks and Eastern Europeans.  Over the years, the symbol has been adopted as an emblem for East Vancouver as a whole but its appearance has generally been tentative rather than overt.  The lack of overtness is, I feel, symptomatic of the underlying meanings that the symbol expresses.  These meanings have to do with problems of injustice, inequality, subjugation and the trauma of poverty and acculturation, particularly as it relates to immigrant life.  My proposal is for a site that sits on a visually messy and peripheral site in East Vancouver.  The East Vancouver symbol is rendered as a 57 foot sculpture that lights up after dark, the word East and Van encircled by a cross delineation that seems to float all on its own.

Instant Coffee has a reclaimed aesthetic and a social intention that played out over the four components: Blanket Bus; Instant Coffee 500; Say Nothing in Bright Colours; and Instant Coffee Light Bar Bus Shelter. All the components functioned as short moments of reprieve as visual fields that are most typically reserved for advertising. Even though Instant Coffee often formally plays with the style of advertising it does so without a clear focused point of sale.For Blanket Bus, Instant Coffee re-positioned and re-scaled the typical hand crafted afghan blanket, wrapping five sides of an articulated bus with large realistic photo images of the blankets. With its erratic and saturated palette and its repetitive grid line and block form, this vernacular aesthetic of the afghan was synthetically ripe, easily appropriated from its modest domestic crafting place and resituated at a larger scale into a public space, one of advertising. Since the artist collective's inception in 2000, Instant Coffee has used language as part of their practice, designing slogans like \"it doesn't have to be good to be meaningful and \"get social or get lost.\" It is through succinct catchphrases, which at times drip with the sincerity of self-help jargon, ring with the urgings of advertising slogans or resound with a dissonant irony, that Instant Coffee applies to Say Nothing in Bright Colours, a series of seven individually hand painted sandwich boards that will be permanently installed in various locations along Main St in Vancouver. Instant Coffee often invites other artists to participate in their projects and they continued this tradition for Instant Coffee 500, where they asked 14 artists to design 16 interior car ad cards to be displayed in one bus. Instant Coffee then asked bus patrons to vote on which artist ad card they like best. For two weeks, transit riders voted on their favorite design via text messaging and online.  The winning artist received a $500.00 prize and their design was featured on the outside of another number three Main Street bus for the remainder of the project. For the Light Bar Bus Shelter, Instant Coffee adapted the Main and West 20th bus shelter into a full spectrum light therapy bar. In a place, such as Vancouver, Canada, with much darkness and rain, the negative effects from this lack of sunlight has on individual psyches and the larger social milieu seems at times seems paramount.

Over the course of the day and night, Flow shifts between live and constructed or theatrical tableaus. During the early morning and after dusk Flow presents as a continuously changing tableau in which hundreds of photographic portraits and landscapes, shot by Fiona Bowie over the last few years, are blended and projected onto a special projection material (switch glass). As viewers come close to the image, this material causes portions of the imagery to disappear as panels of it's surface switch from translucent to clear. A system custom-designed by Bowie and Sidney Fels allows figures shot at different times to appear as if they simultaneously present, with a core group of these figures or actors recurring in a manner that implicitly suggests they're part of a larger narrative. The scenes in Flow change every two to four minutes. The transitions from one scene to another are so slow that the work has been described as having a dream like or hallucinatory quality. Because the project system constantly varies the scale of images (between life size and zoomed in), a particular shot of a particular character may vary from scene to scene, seemingly either fore-grounded or backgrounded. During daylight hours, Flow's dynamic glass projection surface ceates viewing portals, framing details the activity inside and outside. This provides individuals inside with shifting views and details of the street(these views change according to their proximity to the street) and passersby to view activity going on inside the building.The online component of Flow allows viewers to see the work unfold during the day when the site image projectors are off and the site glass is the active component. Visitors are encouraged to engage with the work by clicking on the \"Put words in our mouths\" link to play with dialogue and attribute phrases tocharacters pictured within the work.

Guest curated by Charo Neville, Passage is one of a series of cultural projects that will be on view through the months of February and March along the Carrall Street Greenway in the Downtown Eastside. Yero√≠s project will be visible from the street during the day through the window of Access Gallery.   Peering through a revealed slot in the otherwise darkened window the viewer will experience intense flashes of light, created by flickering LED lights which momentarily highlight knife blades set against a black backdrop in a completely darkened room. The brief beams of light on the spikes of metal suggest the reflection of light created from a lighthouse beacon, announcing a vast dark sea. Engaging the individual senses, yet disorientating the viewer and evoking the feeling of being alone in the middle of a dark ocean at night, the work offers a sense of solitude within the public space of the street. Its contrasting beauty and brutality also incites inevitable reflections about violence and self-preservation in the marginalized neighbourhood in which the work is situated.  As an immigrant to Canada from Cuba, Yero has consistently been concerned with themes that relate to his experience as part of the growing Cuban diaspora. Since living in Canada, Yero still frequently visits his homeland, where many of his family and friends continue to live with limited possibilities to leave. Like the paradoxical freedom and panic that swimming in a wide dark ocean may induce, Cubans are legally bound to their country, which is both home and prison. Many who try to escape across the ocean do not survive, or arrive on the other side only to be returned. The metaphor of death prevails in Yero√≠s practice. The title of the work, Passage, reflects these ideas √± water is evoked as the dual possibility of freedom and death.   This new work also addresses myriad issues of integration and dislocation facing immigrants to a new country. Exhibited during a global event promoting nationalistic pride through marketing terms such as √¨dream,√Æ √¨discover,√Æ and √¨celebrate,√Æ the installation in turn speaks to the underlying complexities of these utopic ideals.

There are two components: a large-scale projection in public space, and an interior projection within the gallery fed by a live surveillance camera. By using participants√≠ video clips documenting the Vancouver 2010 Olympic, Paralympic and related events, viewers are asked to consider the ways in which the International Olympic Committee and the City of Vancouver is represented officially, and the alternative views that are largely dismissed, or written over, by the spectacle machine, which serves to homogenize the Canadian subjectivity. Issues explored are surveillance versus sousveillance, the ways in which we watch events, the ways in which we watch each other and the ways in which we are being watched.Participation consisted simply of video documenting the Olympic, Paralympic and Torch Relay events with cell phones (or any other video capturing device) and the clips were submitted by email and larger files were uploaded to an ftp site. The files were automatically pulled from the inbox and inserted into the video line-up at fifteen minute intervals. These clips were then projected onto the Gallery building, in a gated and locked courtyard, mimicing the inaccessibility of the Olympics. The people could gather on the sidewalk to watch the projection, and that area was monitored by the surveillance camera, which was projected on the wall in the gallery by a live. The gallery audience was essentially watching the audience outside watching the projection of the audience watching the Olympics. There is a two-part archival book project that accompanies the work and is available online at www.liddlethought.blogspot.com. The first part includes contextual texts by Kristina Lee Podesva and Danna Vajda  and images of the Torch Relay. The second part of the book will be available in April. It will function as an archive of the event as it unfolds over the time of the Olympic and Paralympic games. This book project will not only document the work, it will also function as a vehicle for the dissemination of the representations collected that provide an alternate view of the √¨official√Æ versions sanctioned and circulated by VANOC and the City of Vancouver.

The mural suggests the almost mythic presence that crows hold for the population of Vancouver, a bird that has an iconic status in the city. As well, this theme reflects the daily human migration of commuters. Artistically, my challenge was to retain a poetic balance between representation and an underlying abstraction, giving the work an overall harmony and animation. In each of my mural projects, a focus is in the integration of the various elements.In coming up with the motifs, we incorporated about 40 large stencils, generated from small relief prints created in community sessions. This allowed for many individuals to take part, including three mentored youth. Elements are then repeated in differing combinations throughout. Some of the local architecture, including McLean Drive General Store, are referenced, and a large head of a crow in an aboriginal design respects the territory of Native peoples where this wall is located. Artists worked to integrate the upper wall, with the garden area and in particular, with the lower wall, which is made up a series of images from stencils and freehand of insects, plants and seed forms that are indigenous to the area. In all, forty-two people took part. The lower area of the mural was particularly well suited to youth participation, with some as young as three years old, and the oldest participant in his eighties.

But the work also responds to the architecture of the building which is constructed of glass all the way around apart from the concrete core. The two towers are connected by a lower section between them. The building is not rectangular but instead protrudes at different angles drawing diagonal lines in the glass facade. These angles can be seen as mountain peaks and they became the starting point for the light design. Led light lines were mounted on the concrete core horizontally. The lines reveal 40 different preset modes which have been uploaded to the rgb modules. One state is a graphic pattern of a single angle that meets up with angle of the building representing the sihouette of a mountain. This image remains the same but the colors change very gradually. The flow of the colors was inspired by the changes of the seasons and the changes of the day. They blend into each other with fades making the transitions look natural as part of the environment.

Since childhood, every time I√≠ve driven down it, I√≠ve been creeped out by the scary 1930s and 1940s industrial structures to the south √≥ by the endless repetitive loop of fast food and dead underwatered lawns, and by its overabundance of appallingly cheap commercial architecture. In my mind, when children die, their ghosts went to work inside those scary brick buildings. Inside the fast food joints, the fare was probably saltier and greasier than anywhere else, and if you went into one of the businesses or professional buildings, cults would hand you religious pamphlets, and when you left, your clothing would smell like your grandmother√≠s front hall cupboard and a moldy copy of Life magazine with Pat Nixon on the cover.I√≠ve been watching the strip√≠s ongoing redevelopment over the past decade, and while I√≠m glad it√≠s finally changing, I√≠ve been slightly unsure of what it√≠s changing into. The stores are now big and clean and shiny and no longer coma inducing √≥ but maybe every time you buy something there, a penguin dies in Antarctica or a tree is chopped down up north, never to be replanted? Well, that√≠s just me being morbid. It√≠s now actually much better than it was before √≥ the air of unipolar depression is gone √≥ replaced by the early 21st century√≠s version of perfected retail, that of inventory-optimized big box shopping.

And we most of all know the smell of rubber tires √≥ the smell of long-chain carbon molecules off-gassing in a way that no ventilation system can ever fight. And in Canadian Tire, the rubber you smell is possibly a Motomaster whitewall, and that√≠s what Infinite Tire is: a Brancusi-esque expression of joy in all things suburban, a wink to the notion of better living through abundance, and a totem of sorts that acknowledges and revels in the choices and creative freedom that can be inherent in industrial sizing systems.\" - Douglas Coupland, 2012", "SiteName": "Canadian Tire", "SiteAddress": "26 South West Marine Drive", "Neighbourhood": "Marpole", "Latitude": 0.0, "Longitude": 0.0, "LocationOnsite": "", "Type": "Sculpture", "PrimaryMaterial": "", "Ownership": "Privately Owned", "URL": "https:\/\/covapp.vancouver.ca\/PublicArtRegistry\/ArtworkDetail.aspx?ArtworkId=526", "PhotoURL": "https:\/\/covapp.vancouver.ca\/PublicArtRegistry\/ImageDisplay.aspx?AreaId=526&ImageId=702", "PhotoCredits": "Emma Peter", "Artists": "391", "size": 1 }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ 0.0, 0.0 ] } },

The poodle is not associated with a particular culture, and can therefore be enjoyed by a wide range of people along the street and in the surrounding neighbourhoods. Untitled (Poodle) is intended as a curiosity that will bring attention to the sculpture as a marker or icon of time and place.

Waiting for the bus is transformed from a passive pause into a modest social activity. Made of wood and metal and resembling the benches in Vancouver's bus shelters, the artwork is located in close proximity to an existing transit shelter with an integral bench making the visual references clear.A transit bench as teeter-totter creates a playful situation full of possibilities for interaction and negotiation. Uncomfortable when used by only one person, the artwork is best experienced with another person and thus becomes a tool for whimsical social exchange.SeeSawSeat is built with the fulcrum of the bench slighly to one side, so that when then bence is unoccupied, it drops to one side, a clear sign that it is not a fixed bench. The highest point of teh 8-foot-long bench is approximately 28\" above grade when fully tilted.SeeSawSeat was one of three public art projects developed through the Main Street Urban Transportation Showcase (UTS), a plan to encourage reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and more energy efficient transportation practices by improving pedestrian and transit services along Main Street. As part of the Main Street UTS, an art plan was created which led to the commissioning of three public art projects to be installed in the Main Street corridor, including temporary artworks for three Main Street articulated trolley buses.

The mural panels are designed to utilize the structure of the glass panels and their support hardware as integral elements of the overall image structure. The City Centre Station mural is commissioned two times a year by the Public Art Program in partnership with InTransit BC's Canada Line Public Art Program.", "ArtistProjectStatement": "\"When I was first asked to submit a concept for a public art piece to be installed at the Canada Line Station entrance at the intersection of Georgia and Granville Street, I visited the site. Of course I knew beforehand what the function of the entrance was, with its stairs and escalators. But knowing about the function of something versus experiencing it firsthand are different. The first leads to an objective, factual kind of understanding, while the latter leads one to a more poetic understanding in which analogous connections can come to mind. Seeing the toing and froing of commuters going up and down the stairs and escalators brough to my mind remembered experiences of salmon migrating up the Campbell River and its tributaries and the eventual return of new, young salmon downstream to the ocean. Seeing that event left me unexpectedly, strongly affected. I wanted to see if I might be able to bring some aspect of it into my work. So I began making a series of photographs at the Capilano Hatchery in North Vancouver. When the City of Vancouver Public Art Department approached me regarding the creation of a public artwork, I was in the early stages of collecting images of Salmon. But I had not yet reached a decision on how I would eventually employ these images. The Canada Line project brought this into focus for me. I wanted whatever image I created for the Canada Line Station entrance to have a strong connection to the function of the site as well as to life on the Coast of British Columbia. I wanted viewers to be able to recognize and appreciate these connections. Further to this, I hoped to trigger people√≠s thoughts about these wild creatures and how they have exerted such a powerful effect on the rhythm of life along our coast throughout living memory as well as long before that. They have always been central in our cultures and economies. I chose to represent the salmon swimming within a structure that recreates the look of a fish ladder rather than attempting to show them swimming in the wild. I believe this allows viewers to connect my image to the structure and function of the Canada Line entrance, hopefully in a whimsical way. However, the image structure is also meant to allude to our processes for studying the life cycle of salmon, controlling and promoting the continued, healthy reproduction of their various wild species, and ensuring continued future harvests.These fish are full of vitality and a sense of undeterred purpose in the face of all obstacles. They are powerful swimmers that remain wild and mysterious, even when they find themselves channeled through our systems. I have tried to express some of these qualities by catching their images in moments when they are highly animated, swimming through turbulent water filled with swirling bubbles, their bodies dark and unknowable in their watery element.\" - Jim Breukelman, 2013", "SiteName": "Canada Line Vancouver City Centre Stn (Downtown)", "SiteAddress": "Georgia and Granville (Downtown)", "Neighbourhood": "", "Latitude": 0.0, "Longitude": 0.0, "LocationOnsite": "North West Corner", "Type": "Mural", "PrimaryMaterial": "Solid Vinyl sheets - images; Perforated Vinyl - image borders.

Contained in the entire image are four separate scenes, which reflect narratives about monsters and giants based in oral history from the Central Coast. The themes to be taken away from these scenes are Protection, Escape, Rejection, and Balance.The image at the top is titled Raven Meets the Cannibal and the theme of this scene is Protection. The Raven in this scene is both human and bird figure. The Raven is known up and down the coast as a trickster, creator and hero or helper of the people. The figure to the right is known as Baxbaxwalanuksiwe or the Cannibal of the North Door. He is known for keeping humans captive and consuming them. This spirit of consumption can affect humans of all backgrounds. In this image the transformer Raven protects himself and returns the cannibalistic energy of greed and consumption back onto its purveyor. The second scene down depicts Escape. The captive child spirit has found his way out of the basket of the giantess known as the Atsi. Stories of this giant reach up and down the coast, and she goes by many names. My grandfather, Johnny Hanuse, called her √¨Skwanee.√Æ She is known to steal unsuspecting children as they wander too far from the village. Often in the stories told about her, it is the most overlooked child who devises the plan to elude her. This piece was made to honour all of the Residential School child escapees. Over the years I have heard heroic stories of successful and attempted escapes from these schools, and many more fled within their imaginations. The children wanted to go home.The third scene down contains the story of Rejection. P'kvs also known as the Wildman of the Woods is a forest ghost who tries to charm the living into crossing over into the ghost world. He offers gifts, but they are not what they seem. I feel his spirit parallels many figures and entities we deal with in our world today. Many of us choose to cope with reality by accepting illusions, resulting in suffering and living as a ghost. This piece is a reminder to not fall into the false worlds or take in bad medicine.The final scene at the bottom is the Sisiutl, or double-headed sea serpent also known as Winalagalis. What I learn from this monster is the gift of choice and the need for Balance. The choice to build or destroy, and the choice to love or to hate. This serpent was still feared by many and consumed those who were weak in moral strength, but the greater message of the Sisiutl is that it is a choice to be weak or strong in spirit and mind.Although I have briefly described the scenes taking place, I also invite the viewer to construct their own narrative. When creating these designs I was conscious that children would be seeing them at bus stops. I wanted to create something that their imaginations could slip into. It is this ability to be free, to wonder, and to dream that was forcibly taken away by the Church and State-run Residential Schools, and it still a battle to hang on to our culture, languages and spiritual practice.

There are windows on two sides, adding to the illusion of some kind of use value implicit to its presence on the site. The windows are utilitarian, institutional, industrial, with frosted security glass containing wire that obscure a direct line of site into the structure. Within the pavilion is a single, dim light. The pavilion sits immediately to the east of the entrance to the Meccanica development on the corner of First Avenue and Quebec Street in Vancouver, BC. The design borrows from the artdeco influenced electrical substations that are interwoven in Vancouver√≠s urban fabric. The piece looks as if it has been a long-term tenant of the site, as if it belongs to the area and is a relic of an earlier age. The illusion of its permanence is ruptured by a number of elements that disturb a simple and seamless inclusion in the local vernacular. The pavilion√≠s design references utility and yet as a consequence of the breaking up of vertical relations within the piece it becomes obvioussomething else is going on. What possible use could be made of a structure that seems to have no level floor, let alone barely enough room to turn around in? Why would so much attention be paid to the design of such a small and inconsequential piece of infrastructure?Substation Pavilion√≠s design hints at the networks of subterranean connections with the rest of the city and with the past of the site itself. The entire area of False Creek consisted of a marshy wetland prior to its infill. This program of √´reclaiming√≠ the tidal areas of Vancouver allowed for the development of the rail yards and industrial infrastructure at the east end of False Creek. This established a horizontal approach to looking at and moving through the growing city, tied as it was to these rail lines. The vertical tendencies of this project aim to introduce the rupturing of the quotidian relationship with the horizontal that dominates movement through the city. The strata formed in the soil of the False Creek area carry the history of the settlement of the area. The networks of the rail yards spread the stories of the people passing through them,creating layers within the cultural memory of the city. Over the years this cultural detritus molds and rots just as the soil and the structures of the area do. Together they form a humus thatcontains the mold that supports life in the city, spreading underneath every structure we build and every story we tell. This is a fertile substrate, not one given to decay and destruction. It supports connections and unexpected developments, much as the rhizomorphic systems of a large fungus will remain hidden, spreading underground and only exhibiting its presence once ayear with its short-lived mushroom heads.

Legends have been thought about time immemorial and passed on from generation to generation. They are contemporary tales because the story is always changing. An Eagle√≠s spirit, or the spirit of a bear is not always the same thing. Different characteristics and different places mean different things. Kelly and I have created a contemporary design that demonstrates the way nature flows together. In some cases you will see water flowing down a stream, or the wind blowing through the trees, or the trees themselves and their underground roots. Land is: blades of grass, a deer is prancing through from the forest just for the fun of it. A beaver emerges through the reeds at shore, looking for another tree to chew down; he has found it, but is weary of predators all the time. This time, only small creatures of the forest are hidden. Sea is: the west coast dream. Killer whales are chasing salmon around the Salish Sea. Kelp is flowing in the currents, maybe it is herring spawning season. Flounders down below are oblivious to another world above the surface. Cod are hiding amongst the rocks waiting for an easy meal. Life is transient, hardly still, even though we don't see it, branches are deliberately growing, underwater habitats are being bathed with the tide and water vapors rise into the atmosphere to fall far away. Happenings are all around us, ready to be re-discovered again and again.

This animation technique is central to my practice; it consists in the overlapping of two images generating the illusion of a third image. Each work is produced using this method; two grids of pixels are overlapped and set in motion to generate a digital animated moir√à.Alongside the use of digital moir√à, the animations from RIPPLES display a common visual treatment: Streaks of hard-edged pixels combined to a minimal color palette. This visual treatment gives each animation unique graphical and kinetic qualities, reminiscent of early computer graphics and endemic to screens and matrix display technologies.The RIPPLES animations are initially shown on computer screens. They are published online as animated GIFs displayed full screen on HTML pages. The animations operate as seamless loops with no beginning or end; their duration online is determined by the viewer√≠s experience. Meanwhile, each animation encourages a contemplative gaze by combining textural and pixelated elements to a mesmerizing and infinite motion.Specifically, the animations from RIPPLES are informed by memories of rainstorm textures, sand patterns and ocean waves. Each animation attempts to emulate visual and behavioural qualities from these atmospheric elements into digital forms. This process happens slowly through a series of visual experimentations; when a visual experiment feels familiar with the natural references, it is developed to enhance and isolate these specific traits.The resulting works appear like distant recollections of the natural, fluctuating between organic form and digital abstraction. The space of the screen oscillates between depth and flatness, natural and synthetic, merging all into a hybrid form. The flat pixelated graphics flood the monitor, the endless motion does not give rest to the eye.

There is a certain fictional quality to the term √¨coastal city√Æ, metaphorically on the verge of the imaginary, the otherworldly, the historic and the futuristic. √¨From a distance, the work mines the history of travel books from the early 19th century Baedekers to more recent and popular guides such as Lonely Planet and Frommers. While these guidebooks are meant as references for the worldly globetrotter, they nonetheless fulfill the desires of armchair vacationers and urban travellers alike. Upon closer inspection, one notes that the poster is a composite of two images. The smaller of the two images is an excerpt from a larger print, an ocean wave pattern from a woodblock print by Japanese ukiyo-e master Toyohara Kunichika (1835-1900) from a series of prints depicting shipwrecks. √¨Ukiyo√Æ is a Japanese term meaning √¨the floating world√Æ, a reference to the pleasure-seeking urban lifestyles of Edo-period Japan (1600-1867). The larger image is a photograph of Vancouver√≠s False Creek shoreline with objects introduced into the image. One might ask: what is an ikat fabric, a piece of imari-inspired china and a silvered cruciform-topped cruet stopper doing on the shoreline? And what could it all mean?Vancouver Coastal: a nomad√≠s guide to the floating world√Æ is a work that references contemporary and historic nomadic life. Recent events involving travel, global weather patterns and natural occurrences in the Far East and our own West Coast shores have shown evidence of unexpected material and climactic exchange resulting in an archaeological array of accidental artefacts washing up on all shorelines along the Pacific. After all, cultural exchange is not limited to capitalistic trade. These artefacts are accidental travellers, nomadic ephemera that unwittingly influence our cultural landscape and a testimony to the independent life of objects. As the primordial ocean is the birthplace of life, the coastline is the threshold of humanity, our culture and our civilization. As the knowledge of our culture expands through the exchange of ideas, the history of trade can partly be told through the history of our coastline.

Situated in a sensitive geographic location, Vancouver maintains environmental responsibilities that have both local and widespread implications. The material traces of these consequences√≥from remnants of foliage and forests to dried streams of water√≥are evoked in the work, through both production methods to the imagery and aesthetic. The project is an extension of my recent series of unique gelatin silver prints, titled Autograms. The work consists of reproductions of three Autograms resulting in three distinct posters. The project includes images varying in dominant tone (for instance, one that is largely white, one grey, and one black). Creating an overall mood for each poster, this dominant tone can be seen to represent time of day, weather condition, or season. These references to time and the natural world are echoed in both the material processes and compositions of the works. The biomorphic abstractions and √¨textures√Æ are generated by contact printing acrylic paint on translucent plastic film, or utilizing materials that would typically be considered waste (polypropylene drop sheets, shipping packaging, etc.). This uneasy union between synthetic materials produces curiously natural results√≥the fractal forms are reminiscent of everything from rock formations to cedar bark. In this way, I see the works as a form of temporal excavation, resuscitating the organic ancestries of these petroleum products, even alluding to the networks of transportation and commerce required to procure the materials. These allusions to the distant past, and the pre-historic life forms that died to fuel the future, are complicated by references to more recent imaging technology, such as Photoshopped drop-shadows. As these works are made using a contact printing process, the prints are highly detailed and especially compatible with digital enlargement√≥their magnification revealing fractal forms not visible to the naked eye.

Later in the century, in 1995, I was in Ireland and phoning home for voicemail messages and had one from my mother that said, √¨Hi Dear, Constable So-and-so from the Vancouver Police phoned to ask if you√≠d deliberately left your VW parked inside the Hollow Tree in Stanley Park before you left and, to be honest, with you we never know, so could you give him a ring?√Æ My car had been stolen from an underground parkade and abandoned in the tree by joyriders.

The area was covered over to make room for Industry and the CPR railway. The attempted erasure of the space by the colonial forces of the time was thorough and it continues to be built upon today. When looking at some of the public art in Vancouver and other cities we often see a romantic depiction of industrial beginnings and labour. What existed before is often covered and ignored. Knowing that my work will live in this space temporarily I feel it is important to acknowledge its history as well as its present-day. Vancouver is built upon unceded land, sacred sites, complex river and stream systems, hunting and cultivated gathering grounds. It is easy to get lost in the feeling of permanence that urban structures hold. The areas we walk, drive and live upon have place-names and a history of lived experiences.I have lived in Vancouver on and off for around 17 years. Since moving here I have been trying to understand my relationship with this place. I am of mixed Coast Salish ancestry (Klahoose and Sliammon) from my grandmother Agnes Pielle, as well as Wuikinuxv and Kwakwaka'wakw from my grandfather Johnny Hanuse. As a youth I learned that my Grandmother's Nations were historically unified with the Nations here and visually our iconography shares links. The relationship between Nations experienced rupture as a result of colonization. Visually it is important for me to work in continuum with my ancestors. It is also important for me to note that these images do not represent the space they will temporarily live upon, but reflect a relationship and respect for the land and water that my ancestors carried. I strive to continue in this mode of reverence for the spaces we come from and live upon. I also want to recognize my place as an uninvited guest in this space and continue to gain further understanding of it in my time here.An important part of the process in making these pieces has been listening. I have been in conversation with Skwxw√≠u7mesh artist\/knowledge keepers T'uy'tanat (Cease Wyss) and her partner Xuuyaa, as well as other respected community members in the lead up to installing these pieces. I am grateful for their generosity of time and guidance.

It aims to highlight a sense of community despite visible economic and cultural diversity of the neighbourhood. The form is inspired by animals from the Strathcona neighbourhood, the historical precedent of narrative bronze doors in relief, and the phenomenon of √¨Head in the Hole√Æ photo boards. Conceptually, it responds to the colour and texture in the community (particularly the murals), and the desire to identify oneself as part of a community. Bronze doors are heavy and have a ceremonial quality. Often covered in narrative reliefs, they are an early form of storytelling. What is the narrative here at the Library? The name, n???ca? ?mat ct, loosely translates as √¨we are one√Æ in the Musqueam language, and the artwork responds to this sentiment. Introducing animals into the artwork is a way to identify all the library patrons as √¨one√Æ across a loose geographic area without picking out and representing cultural differences which, while is important to celebrate diversity, becomes tricky when it becomes a symbol of ownership and belonging. We all have an innate desire see ourselves in the world around us and understand that we belong somewhere. Through identifying with a character, a cultural symbol or in the capturing of a moment that contains us (the selfie), we place ourselves within acertain context. The artwork takes the form of ?Head in hole? photo board to create a situation in which people of all ages can simultaneously identify with a character\/animal, and see themselves within it.

Conversely, in China, where collectivism has been a core value throughout most of history, the last decade has indicated an increase in individual pursuits. Through their interactive public performances and happenings, PSFO tests where the desire of collective organizationarises naturally from human nature or is an expression of ideology.Fitness For All encourages audience participation. The work is both purely visual (as contemporary sculpture) as well as purpose built and customized to provide a public service. For PSFO, the fitness equipment is secondary to providing space and opportunity for collective gathering with friends, visitors and passersby, thereby advocating for a model of social organization that benefits the community as a whole.", "SiteName": "Shangri-la - Offsite", "SiteAddress": "", "Neighbourhood": "West End", "Latitude": 0.0, "Longitude": 0.0, "LocationOnsite": "West of Shangri-la Hotel (on W.

The initial concept for the sign came from viewing large driftwood logs tossed up on rocks along the beach near the Vancouver Maritime Museum. The large horizontal cedar log was cut from a tree blown down by strong winds in Stanley Park, salvaged and donated by the City of Vancouver. The log has been set onto boulders excavated from the old Carling O'Keefe Brewery site at 12th Avenue and Arbutus, and donated by Intergulf Development Group.The vertical log sculpture is composed of 3 layers of upright logs stepping up and back from the viewer. The first carving on the front set of logs portrays a Coast Salish village with cedar plank houses and beached canoes, a scene which may have been typical around this area prior to European settlement.The carving on the second layer of logs portrays past and present roots of Kitsilano, including a traditional corner store, craftsman-style houses, adn Engine 374, which pulled the first transcontinental train into Vancouver in 1887, was retired to Kitsilano Park for many years, and is now on display in the Roundhouse Community Centre. Also portrayed on this layer is the Vancouver Museum and Pacific Space Centre.The third layer of carved logs portrays a view north across English Bay to Stanley Park, Vancouver's West End, and the North Shore mountains - a scene which is typical from almost any viewpoint in the Kitsilano area.The sign was designed by Kitsilano resident Jim Kostyniuk and carved by BC artist Pete Ryan.

The image has been captured by a thermal imaging camera, normally used by the construction industry, which has been designed to display differences in temperature by detecting light rays that are invisible to the human eye.Most PNE fairgoers are familiar with the Livestock Building, entering through one of its many barn doors along its south side to cheer on the baby pig races, pet the chickens, llamas and rabbits, and ogle animals large and small. What is not so evident when wandering through this expansive space was its change of use in 1942 when the grounds, then known as Hastings Park, were expropriated by the Department of National Defense.With the declaration of war against Japan, the Government of Canada evoked the War Measures Act and authorized removal of √¨all persons of Japanese racial origins,√Æ from the west coast √¨protected area√Æ of British Columbia, even though the majority were Canadian born and Naturalized Canadians. Some 22,000 Japanese Canadians, then labeled √¨enemy aliens,√Æ were uprooted from their homes and sent to various sites, including internment camps, road construction camps and sugar beet farms in the BC interior, Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario. All personal properties, such as fishing boats, farms, businesses and homes, were confiscated and sold without owners√≠ consent to cover the costs of their internment.Beginning in March 16, 1942, some 8,000 persons, removed from fishing, lumber and mining villages along the north coast and Vancouver Island, were held at Hastings Park while campsites to which they were eventually transferred were being developed. The stables and cattle stalls of the Livestock Building were converted into a makeshift women and children√≠s dormitory. Other structures were used as boys and men√≠s dorms, mess halls, kitchen, hospital and isolation ward. Young men were separated from their families, and sent to work at road camp sites. By September, 1942, there were 3,866 women, men and children living in various buildings on thissite.The archival photograph is from a series that local photographer LeonardFrank was contracted to document for the BC Security Commission, which was created in 1942 to oversee the internment process.
